# Modelling the neurons

- [ ] **Setting up a firing mechanism**
	- [x] have it fire at some probability otherwise have it rest
	- [x] create a function that increases the likelihood that one neuron will fire, if another fires
 	- [x] create a neuron class
  	- [ ] upgrade the firing mechanism
  		- [ ] neuron a that randomly fires -> primary sensory neuron
  	 	- [ ] neuron b's membrane potential is increased if neuron a fires and decreased or unaltered if neuron a restst
  	  	- [ ] if neuron b's membrane potential is reached, then it fires
